      <p>My favorite place is the <strong>Museum of Art Pudong (MAP)</strong>. I enjoy
        visiting it every week even if the exhibits don't change very often.
        Since I love this place, I also went there for a summer internship in
        the Department of Public Education and Research.</p>

    <p><strong>Something unexpected about me:</strong> Nothing is expected — I’m
      an INFP and very unpredictable (and sometimes chaotic). I also never fully
      recover from jet lag and often wake up every day at 4 or 5 a.m. I enjoy
      practicing yoga as well.</p>
